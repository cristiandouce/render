# render

  Template render utility. It takes a `template` compiling function and a `locals` object as parameters and calls the first with the second. It also allows setting `globals` by using `render.set` which gets merged at every call.

## Installation

  Install with [component(1)](http://component.io):

    $ component install cristiandouce/render

## Example

```js
  var render = require('render');

  function template(locals) {
    return '<a href="' + locals.link + '" target="_blank">\n'
      + '<span>' + locals.title + '</span>\n'
      + '</a>\n';
  }

  // set some static globals
  render.set('link', 'http://github.com/cristiandouce/render');

  // context `locals`
  var locals = { title: 'cristiandouce/render' };

  render(template, locals);
  // out: <a href="http://github.com/cristiandouce/render" target="_blank"> <span>cristiandouce/render</span> </a>
```

## API

### render(template, locals)

Compiles `template` with `locals` and returns `html` string of result.

```js
var render = require('render');
var template = require('./template');
var locals = { some: 'locals', obj: 1 };

var html = render(template, locals);
// outputs compiled html string
```

### render.dom(template, locals)

Offers a DOM compiled output by hand of [component/domify](https://github.com/component/domify).

```js
var render = require('render');
var template = require('./template');
var locals = { some: 'locals', obj: 1 };

var html = render.dom(template, locals);
// outputs compiled DOM html
```

### render.set(name, local)

Set a `static` global to be merged at every `render` or `render.dom` call.

```js
var render = require('render');

render.set('_i18n', require('component-t'));
// now `_i18n` will be passed to all template compilings using `render`
```
